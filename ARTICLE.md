## How Chinese AI Startup DeepSeek Made a Model that Rivals OpenAI

### https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-model-ai/

This article talks about Deepseek, an open-source AI LLM developed by China. I think it is very interesting as it is open-source and requires much less budget compared to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Consequently, the need for GPU for the LLM has dropped; and the stock price for NVIDIA significantly also dropped. It is going to be interesting watching the competition in AI models between China and the US.

I've been reading a lot about DeepSeek lately, and this article provides a 
really insightful look into its advancements and impact. It's fascinating 
to see how China is positioning DeepSeek as a major player in the AI 
space, pushing the boundaries of large language models and open-source AI.  

What stands out to me is how DeepSeek is not just about competing with 
Western models but also about fostering AI innovation in a unique way. The 
article does a great job of highlighting the broader implications of this 
development in the global AI landscape.

Interesting choice. Yes, Deepseek is the new hot topic now; planning to look into it soon to see if we can save some research money by relying on it instead of OpenAI's models :)
